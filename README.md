**Database Optimization**: Optimize database queries by limiting the number of columns you select, ensuring that you're only retrieving necessary data.Use ->select() to specify columns instead of selecting all.
Consider eager loading related models to reduce database queries using with().

**Caching:** Implement caching for frequently searched terms or results using Laravelâ€™s caching features.
